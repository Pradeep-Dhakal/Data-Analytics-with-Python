	why my is business growing and loss
2. data Asquition 
	collection of data form various sources for anlaysis to aswer thw question raised in step 
	fine handeling
	web scrapppig 
	file format	
3. Data wrangling and exploration (it cunsumed 75% of data scientisist time) 
	data wrangling and exploration is the most importang phase of the data analytics 	process.
		this processes includes 
		Data cleansing 
		data Manipulation 
		data discovery 
		data pattern identfication
	causes of challenges in the data warangling phase 
		unexpected data fotamt 
		Erroneous data
		voluminious data 
		Classifying dat into lnear or clustured 
		determininig relationship between ibservation, features and response

4. Model selection 
	model selection is based on the ocerall data analysis process
	should be accurate to avoide itaration
	Depends in pattern identifiaction and algorithm
	depends on hypothesis building and testing
	leads to building mathmetical statistical function
 
___________EDA graphical techinque _____________

	contruct new featres from raw data cutomatically
	cionstruct new features from raw data manually 

____________Three phase of hypotethis building usng model  __________
phase 1. Model Building
	identify best input variable 
	Eveluate the model's capacity of forecast with these variables
phase 2. model eveluation 
	train and test the module 
	optimization model accuracy, performance, and comparision with models 
phase 3. model deployment 
	use the mdoel for predction
